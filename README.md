Multiplayer FPS in Unity
========

This project was created following tutorials by [Brackeys](https://github.com/Brackeys). If you want to learn how to build something like this watch the videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPV2KyIb3jR5PhGqsO7G4PsbEC_Al-kPZ).

This project is a multiplayer first-person shooter game in Unity.

My goal here is to make a well documented game project for others to clone and change to their liking.

## Software
- This project runs on the [Unity](http://unity3d.com) engine. Make sure to have the newest version installed before running the project.

## Project Structure
The project has the following structure:

- **Assets:** Assets used in unity for building the game.
  - **GUI:** Assets used for the game's GUI.
  - **Materials:** The materials used in the game.
  - **Models:** Models imported for the game (e.g.: the weapon model).
  - **PlayerModel:** The model imported for the Player.
  - **Prefabs:** All unity prefabs created for this game.
  - **Scripts:** C# scripts used in the game.
  - **Standard Assets:** Unity assets imported for the game (could do some cleanup).
- **Builds:** Latest builds for different OS.
  - **OSX:** The latest build for OSX.
  - **Windows:** The latest build for Windows.
- **ProjectSettings:** Unity project settings files.

My goal is to have a readme on each of this important directories explaining a bit more.

## TODO
 - **Better documentation**
  - Add readme to directories:
    - Prefabs
    - Scripts
      - Player
      - Weapon
    - Builds
    - Models

    - GUI

- **Bugs**
    - When you die shooting, you spawn shooting.
